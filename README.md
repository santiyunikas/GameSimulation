# GameSimulation
GameSimulation is made for the needs of the design patterns's courses.
This Simulation was built using two Design Patterns.
The pattern that is suitable for simulating this game is a combination of Singleton and Abstract Factory.
The reason is because in Singleton implementation it limits the use of classes that become instances in an application. In this case it can be defined that instances that are limited by Singleton pattern are user instances, where in one game only one instance is needed.
Whereas Abstract Factory is used to make enemy objects, accessories, skins and weapons that can be accessed at any time by the user. These four objects have different specifications so they are suitable for using Abstract Factory.
